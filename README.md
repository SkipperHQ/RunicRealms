# RunicRealms
RunicRealms is a text-based adventure RPG set in a medieval fantasy world, explore different areas, battle monsters, collect loot and craft different items with your monster drops.

I started RunicRealms with one goal in mind; to improve and build upon my experience in using Python. I hope that one day, I might be able to create either a 2D -- or potentially even a 3D game that resembles this, if not very similar.

If you find any bugs with code, or just have any general tips, suggestions, or comments regarding the game or its concepts, please feel free to contact me using one of the below contact links.
